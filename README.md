CzeRuValency
============
The experiment concerns comparative study of valency for the two related Slavic languages - Czech and Russian.
Though it seem to be very similar at the first sight, it is actually not the fact.
I used a valency lexicon Vallex with manually annotated cca 4,000 verbs, a dictionary and a parallel corpus to
make a table of Czech-Russian valency correspondences.


In the folder python, a python script to transform a dictionary Ruslan
and a valency information encoded in it into a human-readible format.
